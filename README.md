# VIPER(SwiftUIkit, SwiftUI) + Modularisation (NetworkKIt in SwiftPackage) + UnitTests
Project Overview
This demonstration project highlights my expertise in Swift, SwiftUI, and UIKit, showcasing modern architectural patterns and testing practices.

Key Features:
 • Architecture: VIPER (with SwiftUIkit + SwiftUI) and scalable modularization using dynamic development libraries (swift Packages).
 • Testing: Comprehensive unit & UI tests, including validation for authentication (email and password) and TabBar button functionality.
 • API Implementation: gRPC as a REST API substitute to demonstrate flexibility in API integrations.
 • Tech Stack: SwiftUIkit, SwiftUI, Combine, SnapKit, gRPC, adhering to SOLID principles and Clean Architecture.

This project is a testament to my ability to create scalable, testable, and maintainable applications, leveraging advanced iOS development techniques.
